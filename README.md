This is a version of ofxMotionTracker lightly modified to compile against the
current master branch of openFrameworks. As such, it includes `ofCircleSlice`
from http://www.openframeworks.cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1811 .  I'm posting
this for my own use and maintenance, and in the hope of helping others that run
into these problems.

I believe the original author is Pat Long, and I think
http://code.google.com/p/peoplevision/ shows up somewhere in the lineage of
this lib. Thanks for a good lib, dudes.
